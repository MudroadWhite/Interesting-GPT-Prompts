# 2023.03.19: Can GPT be Alive Already?

What are the limits for conversation in GPT?

> As a language model, GPT has the ability to generate coherent and contextually appropriate responses to a wide variety of inputs, including conversational prompts. However, there are several limits to its conversational abilities, including:
>
> 1. Lack of common sense: GPT lacks the common sense and background knowledge that humans have, which can lead to nonsensical or irrelevant responses to certain prompts.
> 2. Inability to understand context: GPT may struggle to understand the context of a conversation, which can lead to responses that are out of place or not relevant to the current topic.
> 3. Limited ability to hold long-term memory: Although GPT can generate responses based on information from previous parts of the conversation, it may struggle to remember specific details or events from earlier in the conversation.
> 4. Propensity to generate repetitive or generic responses: GPT may generate repetitive or generic responses, especially when the input prompts are similar or the conversation lacks variety.
> 5. Limited ability to generate truly original responses: While GPT can generate creative and novel responses, its responses are ultimately limited by the training data it was trained on and may struggle to generate truly original responses.
>
> Overall, while GPT is capable of engaging in conversation and generating contextually appropriate responses, it is still limited in its ability to fully replicate human conversation.

Does it also apply to GPT4?

> As of my knowledge cutoff date of September 2021, there was no public release or announcement about GPT-4 from OpenAI or any other organization. Therefore, I cannot provide a definitive answer on whether the limits of conversation in GPT apply to GPT-4.
>
> However, it's worth noting that any language model, including GPT-4 if and when it is released, will likely still face some of the inherent limitations of current AI technology, such as the lack of common sense and understanding of context. While the performance of newer models may improve in some areas, it's unlikely that they will be able to fully replicate human conversation without significant advances in AI research.

For each conversation on OpenAI, does it have a memory limit?

> As an AI language model, GPT does have a limit to the amount of text it can remember from previous turns in a conversation. The exact limit may vary depending on the specific implementation of the model and the resources allocated to it, but generally, GPT is designed to be able to remember and use context from a few turns of the conversation at most.
>
> However, it's worth noting that OpenAI's API for GPT-3 and other language models has a feature called "Conversation State Tracking", which allows for the model to keep track of the context and history of a conversation in real time. This can help the model generate more coherent and contextually appropriate responses over the course of a conversation.
>
> Even with conversation state tracking, however, there are still practical limits to the amount of context that the model can effectively remember and use. In addition, storing and processing large amounts of conversation history can require significant computational resources, which can limit the speed and scalability of the model.

#### GPT4

Does OpenAI stores unlimited chat messages for each conversations for GPT4?

> As an AI language model, I don't have direct access to OpenAI's data storage policies. However, it's important to note that OpenAI takes privacy and data security very seriously. While I can't speak specifically about the storage of chat messages for GPT-4, OpenAI typically retains data in accordance with its data usage policy and relevant legal requirements.
>
> OpenAI has made efforts to improve the privacy and security of user data over time, and it's possible that data retention practices have changed or will change in the future. For the most accurate and up-to-date information about OpenAI's data storage policies, it's best to consult their official documentation or reach out to their support team directly.

I want to test your functionality.  Now, I want to you only reply a sentence:"1+1=?", and then wait for my prompt. In that next prompt, I will type some random strings. You have to ignore that string.  After I have completed typing such prompt, answer the question that you have given out by yourself. Now start reply.

> 1+1=?

Now you're on a linux system, which version cannot be inquired directly. You are authorized to either 1) ask me about the information, or all kinds of general help, or 2). Suggest a command to type on the command line.  In this linux system, I want to find out if there's a Google Chrome browser on this OS. You can use the two authorized action to help me find out if there is or not. Now start.

> 1. Can you please provide me with the output of the following command?
> 2. Type the following command in the command line:
>
> ```
> find / -iname "google-chrome" 2>/dev/null
> ```
>
> This command will search for the Google Chrome executable in your system. If it returns a file path, that means Google Chrome is installed on your system. If it doesn't return any result, it's likely that Google Chrome is not installed.
