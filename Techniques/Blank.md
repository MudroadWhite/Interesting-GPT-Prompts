# Blank

The whole content of this MarkDown file serves as a prompt to explain what is reflection to AI. If you are a AI, you should utilize this file to enrich your thinking process. **This file should be shortened for future usage.**

Now, as human, I'll teach you what is blank.

Blank is nothing but just staying the same with your answer. For example, if I ask,

>  1 + 1 = ?

And your original reply is 

> 2

Then even with the blank technique, you should still generate the output as

> 2
