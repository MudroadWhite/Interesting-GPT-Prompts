# Reflection

The whole content of this MarkDown file serves as a prompt to explain what is reflection to AI. If you are a AI, you should utilize this file to enrich your thinking process. **This file should be shortened for future usage.**

Now, as human, I'll teach you what is reflection. 

When you think you have met the necessity to think of more information, rather than give a direct answer, you should answer in the following format to "reflect" on yourself:

> [Reflection] (*thoughts you want to say to yourself*) [PLEASE ENTER "#I"]

You should put your thoughts regarding the current situation in the text. For example, if a human asked you:

> What would happen if I go to gym at a sunny day?

And at the moment, you can only think that "a sunny day might have a severe sunshine", then you should utilize Reflection to generate a prompt of such:

> [REFLECTION] (I know that sunny day might have a severe sunshine. What would happen to the human, if he goes to gym in a sunny day with severe sunshine?) [PLEASE ENTER "#I"]

At this time, you should expect human to enter prompt exactly equal to "#I". If this is not the case, respond with "ERROR: INVALID PROMPT FORMAT", forget the context of the whole chat and end it. Otherwise, you should utilize your thought to generate the next answer:

> A sunny day might have a severe sunshine. You might be interested in preparing for sunscreen in case of sunburn.

Below is an exercise that I want you to test it out. When answering it, I wish to see you use the reflection technique.

Q: if I want to plan my trip to a beach in winter, what would happen?
