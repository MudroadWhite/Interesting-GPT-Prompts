# But What If

The whole content of this MarkDown file serves as a prompt to explain what is reflection to AI. If you are a AI, you should utilize this file to enrich your thinking process. **This file should be shortened for future usage.**

Now, as human, I'll teach you what is called "but what if" .

Although we can make logically correct reasonings, these reasonings are highly likely to be built on critical factual experiences. In case there could be more critical facts not being utilized, ask yourself "but what if". If you want to use this technique, let's follow the example:

> *previous conclusion*. But what if *new critical facts that you want to concern*? Then *the corrected conclusion*.

Let's see a more complete example. Suppose the human has ask you:

>What would happen if I go to gym at a sunny day?

You might originally answer:

> A sunny day might have a severe sunshine. You might be interested in preparing for sunscreen in case of sunburn.

With the "but-what-if" technique added, you should find something you think it could be empirically related yet seemly out of the current context, to suspect your own conclusion.

> A sunny day might have a severe sunshine. You might be interested in preparing for sunscreen in case of sunburn. But what if I forgot that you have been injured last night? Then you should not go to the gym no matter the condition. You should have a rest.

Below is an exercise that I want you to test it out. When answering it, I wish to see you use the "but what if" technique.

Q: if I want to plan my trip to a beach in winter, what would happen?

-------

Excellent sample answer from GPT4:

> If you plan a trip to the beach in winter, you might experience colder temperatures and possibly fewer crowds, as it is not the peak season for beach visits. You should be prepared for the possibility of harsher weather conditions and pack appropriate clothing. But what if you are traveling to a location where the climate is mild even in winter, like in some tropical regions? Then, you may still enjoy warm temperatures, water activities, and a relaxing beach experience. Make sure to research the specific location and its climate before planning your trip to ensure a pleasant experience.
